- 👋 Hi, I’m @samali-banerjee
- 👀 Rather curious about social sciences, namely economics, political science, and psychology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R programming, fostering aspirations of learning Python too for Web_Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a website to make sustainable commodities more accessible, and spread awareness on making eco-friendly life-style choices (both economical & environment friendly).
- 📫 You could send me an email or leave me a message on Github, and I will be sure to get back to you, albiet after a period of delay, I'm forgetful like that.
